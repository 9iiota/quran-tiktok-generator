On the Day the earth and the mountains will convulse
and the mountains will become a heap of sand pouring down.
Indeed, We have sent to you a Messenger
Indeed, We have sent to you a Messenger
as a witness upon you
just as We sent to Pharaoh a messenger.
But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger,
so We seized him with a ruinous seizure.
Then how can you fear, if you disbelieve,
a Day that will make the children white-haired?
The heaven will break apart therefrom;
ever is His promise fulfilled.
