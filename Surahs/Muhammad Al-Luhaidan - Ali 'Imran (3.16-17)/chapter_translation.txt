Those who say, "Our Lord, indeed we have believed,
so forgive us our sins
so forgive us our sins
and protect us from the punishment of the Fire,"
The patient,
the true,
the obedient,
those who spend [in the way of Allah],
those who spend [in the way of Allah],
and those who seek forgiveness before dawn.
