O My servants who have believed,
indeed My earth is spacious,
so worship only Me.
Every soul will taste death.
Every soul will taste death.
Then to Us will you be returned.
And those who have believed
and done righteous deeds
We will surely assign to them
of Paradise [elevated] chambers
chambers beneath which rivers flow,
wherein they abide eternally.
Excellent is the reward of the [righteous] workers
