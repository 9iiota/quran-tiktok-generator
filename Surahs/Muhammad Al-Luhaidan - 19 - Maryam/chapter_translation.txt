On the Day We will gather the righteous
to the Most Merciful as a delegation
And will drive the criminals to Hell in thirst
And will drive the criminals to Hell in thirst
None will have [power of] intercession
except he who had taken from the Most Merciful a covenant.
And they say, "The Most Merciful has taken [for Himself] a son."
You have done an atrocious thing.
The heavens almost rupture therefrom
and the earth splits open
and the mountains collapse
The heavens almost rupture therefrom
and the earth splits open
and the earth splits open
and the mountains collapse in devastation
That they attribute to the Most Merciful a son.
And it is not appropriate for the Most Merciful
that He should take a son.
And it is not appropriate for the Most Merciful
that He should take a son.
