Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them - so worship Him and have patience for His worship. Do you know of any similarity to Him?"
And man [i.e., the disbeliever] says, "When I have died, am I going to be brought forth alive?"
Does man not remember that We created him before, while he was nothing?
So by your Lord, We will surely gather them and the devils; then We will bring them to be present around Hell upon their knees.
Then We will surely extract from every sect those of them who were worst against the Most Merciful in insolence.
Then, surely it is We who are most knowing of those most worthy of burning therein.
And there is none of you except he will come to it. This is upon your Lord an inevitability decreed.
Then We will save those who feared Allah and leave the wrongdoers within it, on their knees.
And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, those who disbelieve say to those who believe, "Which of [our] two parties is best in position and best in association?"
And how many a generation have We destroyed before them who were better in possessions and [outward] appearance?
Say, "Whoever is in error - let the Most Merciful extend for him an extension [in wealth and time] until, when they see that which they were promised - either punishment [in this world] or the Hour [of resurrection] - they will come to know who is worst in position and weaker in soldiers."
And Allah increases those who were guided, in guidance, and the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord for reward and better for recourse.
Then, have you seen he who disbelieved in Our verses and said, "I will surely be given wealth and children [in the next life]"?
Has he looked into the unseen, or has he taken from the Most Merciful a promise?
No! We will record what he says and extend [i.e., increase] for him from the punishment extensively.
And We will inherit him [in] what he mentions, and he will come to Us alone.
And they have taken besides Allah [false] deities that they would be for them [a source of] honor.
No! They [i.e., those "gods"] will deny their worship of them and will be against them opponents [on the Day of Judgement].
Do you not see that We have sent the devils upon the disbelievers, inciting them [to evil] with [constant] incitement?
So be not impatient over them. We only count out [i.e., allow] to them a [limited] number.
On the Day We will gather the righteous to the Most Merciful as a delegation
And will drive the criminals to Hell in thirst
None will have [power of] intercession except he who had taken from the Most Merciful a covenant.
And they say, "The Most Merciful has taken [for Himself] a son."
You have done an atrocious thing.
The heavens almost rupture therefrom and the earth splits open and the mountains collapse in devastation
That they attribute to the Most Merciful a son.
And it is not appropriate for the Most Merciful that He should take a son.
There is no one in the heavens and earth
but that he comes to the Most Merciful as a servant.
He has enumerated them
and counted them a [full] counting.
And all of them are coming to Him
on the Day of Resurrection alone.
Indeed, those who have believed
and done righteous deeds -
the Most Merciful will appoint for them affection.
So, [O Muhammad],
We have only made it [i.e., the Qurâ€™an]
easy in your tongue [i.e., the Arabic language]
that you may give good tidings thereby to the righteous
and warn thereby a hostile people.
And how many have We destroyed before them of generations?
Do you perceive of them anyone
or hear from them a sound?
