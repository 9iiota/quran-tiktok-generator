And whoever turns away from My remembrance -
indeed, he will have a depressed [i.e., difficult] life,
and We will gather [i.e., raise] him on the Day of Resurrection blind."
He will say, "My Lord, why have you raised me blind
while I was [once] seeing?"
[Allah] will say, "Thus did Our signs come to you,
and you forgot [i.e., disregarded] them;
and thus will you this Day be forgotten."
