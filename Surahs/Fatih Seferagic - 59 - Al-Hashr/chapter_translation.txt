If We had sent down this Qurâ€™an upon a mountain,
you would have seen it humbled
you would have seen it humbled
and splitting from fear of Allah.
And these examples We present to the people
that perhaps they will give thought.
He is Allah,
He is Allah, other than whom there is no deity,
Knower of the unseen and the witnessed.
He is the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.
He is Allah,
He is Allah, other than whom there is no deity,
the Sovereign, the Pure, the Perfection, 
the Grantor of Security, the Overseer,
the Exalted in Might, the Compeller, the Superior.
Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him.
He is Allah,
He is Allah, the Creator, the Producer, the Fashioner;
to Him belong the best names.
Whatever is in the heavens and earth is exalting Him.
And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
