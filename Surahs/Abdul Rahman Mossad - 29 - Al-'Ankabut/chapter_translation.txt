They urge you to hasten the punishment.
And indeed, Hell will be encompassing of the disbelievers
On the Day the punishment will cover them from above them
and from below their feet
and it is said, "Taste [the result of] what you used to do."
O My servants who have believed,
indeed My earth is spacious,
so worship only Me.
Every soul will taste death.
Every soul will taste death.
Then to Us will you be returned.
And those who have believed
and done righteous deeds
We will surely assign to them
of Paradise [elevated] chambers
chambers beneath which rivers flow,
wherein they abide eternally.
Excellent is the reward of the [righteous] workers
Who have been patient and upon their Lord rely.
Who have been patient and upon their Lord rely.
And how many a creature carries not its [own] provision.
Allah provides for it and for you.
And He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
