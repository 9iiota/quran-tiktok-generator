There is no one in the heavens and earth
but that he comes to the Most Merciful as a servant.
He has enumerated them and counted them a [full] counting.
And all of them are coming to Him
on the Day of Resurrection alone.
Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds -
the Most Merciful will appoint for them affection.
So, [O Muhammad], We have only made it [i.e., the Qurâ€™an]
easy in your tongue [i.e., the Arabic language]
that you may give good tidings thereby to the righteous
and warn thereby a hostile people.
And how many have We destroyed before them of generations?
Do you perceive of them anyone
or hear from them a sound?
