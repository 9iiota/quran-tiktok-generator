Indeed, those who do not expect the meeting with Us
and are satisfied with the life of this world
and feel secure therein
and those who are heedless of Our signs -
For those their refuge will be the Fire
because of what they used to earn.
Indeed, those who have believed
and done righteous deeds -
their Lord will guide them
because of their faith.
Beneath them rivers will flow
in the Gardens of Pleasure.
Their call therein will be,
"Exalted are You, O Allah,"
and their greeting therein will be,
"Peace."
And the last of their call will be,
"Praise to Allah, Lord of the worlds!"
