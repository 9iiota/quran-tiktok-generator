Indeed, I am Allah. There is no deity except Me,
so worship Me and establish prayer for My remembrance.
Indeed, the Hour is coming - I almost conceal it -
so that every soul may be recompensed according to that for which it strives.
So do not let one avert you from it
who does not believe in it and follows his desire,
for you [then] would perish.
