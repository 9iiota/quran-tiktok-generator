They said, "O Mary,
you have certainly done a thing unprecedented.
O sister [i.e., descendant] of Aaron,
your father was not a man of evil,
nor was your mother unchaste."
So she pointed to him.
They said, "How can we speak
to one who is in the cradle a child?"
[Jesus] said, "Indeed, I am the servant of Allah.
He has given me the Scripture
and made me a prophet.
And He has made me blessed wherever I am
And He has made me blessed wherever I am
and has enjoined upon me prayer
and zakah as long as I remain alive
And [made me] dutiful to my mother,
and He has not made me a wretched tyrant.
And peace is on me the day I was born
and the day I will die
and the day I am raised alive."
