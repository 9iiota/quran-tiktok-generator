[To whom Allah will say], "O My servants,
no fear will there be concerning you this Day,
nor will you grieve,
[You] who believed in Our verses
and were Muslims.
Enter Paradise,
you and your kinds, delighted."
Circulated among them will be plates
and vessels of gold.
And therein is whatever the souls desire
and [what] delights the eyes,
and you will abide therein eternally.
And that is Paradise
which you are made to inherit
for what you used to do.
For you therein is much fruit
from which you will eat.
