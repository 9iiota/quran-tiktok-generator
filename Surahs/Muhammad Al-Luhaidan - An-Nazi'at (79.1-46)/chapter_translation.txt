But when there comes the greatest Overwhelming Calamity -
But when there comes the greatest Overwhelming Calamity -
The Day when man will remember that for which he strove,
The Day when man will remember that for which he strove,
And Hellfire will be exposed
And Hellfire will be exposed for [all] those who see -
And Hellfire will be exposed for [all] those who see -
So as for he who transgressed
And preferred the life of the world,
Then indeed,
Hellfire will be [his] refuge.
Then indeed,
Hellfire will be [his] refuge.
But as for he who feared the position of his Lord
But as for he who feared the position of his Lord
and prevented the soul
and prevented the soul from [unlawful] inclination,
Then indeed, Paradise
Then indeed, Paradise
Then indeed,
Paradise will be [his] refuge.
