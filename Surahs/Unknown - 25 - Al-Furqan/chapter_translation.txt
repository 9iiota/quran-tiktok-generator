And [they are] those who do not testify to falsehood,
and when they pass near ill speech, they pass by with dignity.
And those who, when reminded of the verses of their Lord,
do not fall upon them deaf
do not fall upon them deaf and blind.
And those who say, "Our Lord, grant us from among our wives
and offspring comfort to our eyes
and make us
and make us a leader [i.e., example] for the righteous."
Those will be awarded the Chamber for what they patiently endured,
and they will be received therein with greetings and [words of] peace
