verse,ar,en
,وَالضُّحَى,By the morning brightness
,وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا سَجَى,"And [by] the night when it covers with darkness,"
,مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ,"Your Lord has not taken leave of you, [O Muhammad],"
,وَمَا قَلَى,nor has He detested [you].
,وَلَلْءَاخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لَّكَ مِنَ الْأُولَى,And the Hereafter is better for you than the first [life].
,وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَبُّكَ,"And your Lord is going to give you,"
,فَتَرْضَى,and you will be satisfied.
,أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيمًا,Did He not find you an orphan
,فََٔاوَى,and give [you] refuge?
,وَوَجَدَكَ ضَالًّا,And He found you lost
,فَهَدَى,"and guided [you],"
,وَوَجَدَكَ عَائِلًا,And He found you poor
,فَأَغْنَى,and made [you] self-sufficient.
,فَأَمَّا الْيَتِيمَ,"So as for the orphan,"
,فَلَا تَقْهَرْ,do not oppress [him].
,وَأَمَّا السَّائِلَ,"And as for the petitioner,"
,فَلَا تَنْهَرْ,do not repel [him].
,وَأَمَّا بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ,"But as for the favor of your Lord,"
,فَحَدِّثْ,report [it].
