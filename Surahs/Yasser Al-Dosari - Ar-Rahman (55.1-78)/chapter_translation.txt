Everyone upon it [i.e., the earth] will perish,
And there will remain the Face of your Lord,
Owner of Majesty and Honor.
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?
Whoever is within the heavens and earth asks Him;
every day He is in [i.e., bringing about] a matter.
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?
We will attend to you,
O prominent beings.
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?
O company of jinn and mankind,
if you are able to pass beyond
if you are able to pass beyond
the regions of the heavens and the earth,
then pass.
You will not pass
except by authority [from Allah].
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?
