,فَبِمَا نَقْضِهِم مِّيثَقَهُمْ,And [We cursed them] for their breaking of the covenant
,وَكُفْرِهِم بَِٔايَتِ اللَّهِ,and their disbelief in the signs of Allah
,وَقَتْلِهِمُ الْأَنبِيَاءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ,and their killing of the prophets without right
,وَقَوْلِهِمْ قُلُوبُنَا غُلْفٌ,"and their saying, ""Our hearts are wrapped"" [i.e., sealed against reception]."
,بَلْ طَبَعَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهَا بِكُفْرِهِمْ,"Rather, Allah has sealed them because of their disbelief,"
,فَلَا يُؤْمِنُونَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا,"so they believe not, except for a few."
,وَبِكُفْرِهِمْ,And [We cursed them] for their disbelief
,وَقَوْلِهِمْ عَلَى مَرْيَمَ بُهْتَنًا عَظِيمًا,and their saying against Mary a great slander

,عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ,"Jesus the son of Mary,"
,رَسُولَ اللَّهِ,"the messenger of Allah."""
,وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ,"And they did not kill him,"
,وَمَا صَلَبُوهُ,nor did they crucify him;
,وَلَكِن شُبِّهَ لَهُمْ,but [another] was made to resemble him to them.
,وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ اخْتَلَفُوا فِيهِ لَفِى شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ,"And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it."
,مَا لَهُم بِهِ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِلَّا اتِّبَاعَ الظَّنِّ,They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption.
,وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ يَقِينًا,"And they did not kill him, for certain."
,بَل رَّفَعَهُ اللَّهُ إِلَيْهِ,"Rather, Allah raised him to Himself."
,بَل رَّفَعَهُ اللَّهُ إِلَيْهِ,"Rather, Allah raised him to Himself."
,وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَزِيزًا حَكِيمًا,And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise.
,وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَبِ,And there is none from the People of the Scripture
,إِلَّا لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ,"but that he will surely believe in him [i.e., Jesus] before his death."

,أُحِلَّتْ لَهُمْ,"which had been lawful to them,"
,وَبِصَدِّهِمْ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ كَثِيرًا,and for their averting from the way of Allah many [people]
