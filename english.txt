They urge you to hasten the punishment.
And indeed, Hell will be encompassing of the disbelievers
On the Day the punishment will cover them from above them
and from below their feet
and it is said, "Taste [the result of] what you used to do."
O My servants who have believed,
indeed My earth is spacious,
so worship only Me.
Every soul will taste death.
Every soul will taste death.
Then to Us will you be returned.
